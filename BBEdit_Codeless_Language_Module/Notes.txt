These are Codeless Language Modules for BBEdit. They will allow automatic colouring of GMT scripts edited in BBEdit.

Per directions here:

http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html

one of these should be placed in the "Language Modules" subfolder of BBEdit's application support folder normally located in

/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/

~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/


ShellVars will colour shell script variables in the form ${VARIABLE_NAME} in the same colour as strings.

Normal will give ${VARIABLE_NAME} blocks the same colour as plain text.
